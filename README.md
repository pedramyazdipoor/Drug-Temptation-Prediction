## Drug Temptation Prediction

In this project our goal is to predict the drug temptation level(five levels) among university students.\
We employed Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Multi-layer Perceptron achieving strong predictive results.\
The dataset is a psychological self-report questionnaire that over 700 students participated in and has 32 features such as education level 
of students' parents, gender, age and several psychological questions.\
We faced with so many missing values and we addressed this problem through various data imputation methods(avg value for numeric features,
most frequent value for categorical features and 'no opinion' for psychological questions).\
The dataset is not available for downloading due to privacy and license issues.\
