In this project our goal is to predict the drug temptation level(five levels) among university students.
We employed Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Multi-layer Perceptron achievingstrong predictive results.
The dataset is a self questionnaire that has 32 features such as education level of students' parents, gender, age and several psychological questions.
We faced with so many missing values and we addressed this problem through various imputation methods(avg value for numeric features,
most frequent value for categorical features and 'no opinion' for psychological questions).
The dataset is not available for downloading due to privacy and license issues.
